## Surprises as a Mechanism of Improvement in the Psychological Therapy of Anxiety and Depression in Young People

Young people are often affected by social anxiety _and_ depression and are particularly impaired.

Some of these young people improve substantially with treatment--we ask:

_how_ do they improve--what are the causal mechanisms and can we maximise them?

_who_ improves--could we tell you will get better in advance?

_whether_ the way we pursue improvement is relevant and acceptable



## Social Anxiety and Depression co-occur

- Two of the most common conditions in young people that co-occur at high frequency  



- Their co-occurrence causes a higher burden to individuals. 


## Social Anxiety and Depression can be effectively treated

## What is the active ingredient of the treatment? 

_Surprises_: a better outcome than expected. 

Surprises underlie learning. 

Surprises shape affect in the moment.

## What is the active ingredient of the treatment? 

In social anxiety treatment, surprises are maximised.

Treatment is designed as such with experiments in which surprises are engineered. 

a surprise occurs when the outcome of a social interaction is better than expected, that is the beliefs that the person initially held about the outcome of the interaction are disconfirmed


## 
The way we process oursevels can get in the way. 

-  _self-focused attention_: too much attention on how we come across

when shifted outwards--anxiety improved.

-  _safety behaviours_: precautions to ao avoid/"not get caught"

when dropped--anxiety improved.

-  _negative self image_: look terrible anyway

when held positive image--anxiety improved.


## What is the active ingredient of the treatment? 

maximise surprises and shift self-processing variables

distinguish between three models



## WP1: Establish what is causal about the intervention
Compare three models in experimental set up. 

Outcome is anxiety and mood in the moment  

Variables are the ones from the three models.   

Why important: 

## WP2: Develop computational models

Recently developed model that incorporates surprises and rewards

Rewards: positive outcome

Surprises: better than expected outcome

Why important: 

## WP3: Identify neural and interoceptive markers of social interactions.

MEG

Interoception

## WP4: Create ecologically valid, scalable version of experiment

This is the basis for our WP5. We want to create a version that is online of what the original experiment is by Dr Leigh--an online social experiment. 
This will allow this to be scalable--which means we can do a big online sample.


## WP5: Trial efficacy of active ingredient

Does our intervention work? If we are right, even a small exposure to an online game, such as the one in WP1 should have a big effect. 

## WP5: Inter-individual differences

Can we predict who will respond?

## WPX: Establish ethical and epistemic viability of manipulations 

How can we find out about what young people want.
